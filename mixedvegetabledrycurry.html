						<h1>MIXED VEGETABLE DRY CURRY</h1>
						<div class="article">
							<p><a class="boldlink" href="index.html">back to recipe list</a></p>	
							<p>This is another recipe from <a href="http://www.mamtaskitchen.com/">Mamta's Kitchen</a>. You can find the original recipe  <a href="http://www.mamtaskitchen.com/recipe_display.php?id=10531">here</a>. I have adjusted it slightly.</p>
							<p>If you use vegetables with a high water content you'll have an easier time sticking to the "no added water" rule. All types of cabbage are good for this. It's a technique that may take a bit of trial and error to get right. The first time I tried it the vegetable pieces were too large and my mix wasn't producing enough moisture. You will quickly get the hang out it.  The taste is amazing.  Definitely worth it.</p>
							<p>I use a non-stick, <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/60129463/">wok-style pan</a> from IKEA with a heavy glass lid for these dry curry recipes. However, despite IKEA's description the bottom of it is pretty thin and I have to be careful not to burn the vegetables.  Any pan with a heavy bottom and a heavy, tight fitting lid, would be ideal for these dry curry recipes.</p>

								<h2>ingredients</h2>
								<p>200 grams of vegetables cut into smallish chunks</p>
								<p>1 teaspoon grated fresh garlic</p>
								<p>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</p>
								<p>1-2 serrano chilis, minced</p>
								<p>2-3 tablespoons oil (I use olive oil)</p>
								<p>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</p>
								<p>1 teaspoon coriander powder</p>
								<p>0.5 teaspoon turmeric powder</p>
								<p>0.25 teaspoon cayenne powder (leave out if you're using chilis)</p>
								<p>0.5 teaspoon salt (add more later if necessary)</p>
								<p>lemon juice to taste</p>
								<p>0.5 teaspoon ground garam masala</p>
								<p>1 tablespoon chopped cilantro</p>

								<h2>instructions</h2>
								<p>Heat the oil and when hot add cumin seeds. When they start to sizzle and darken a bit add the ginger, garlic, and the chopped green chilis.  Fry for 30 seconds or so.</p>
								<p>Add the chopped vegetables, the spices (except for the garam masala), salt and saute for a minute or so until the vegetables are coated with the spices.</p>
								<p>Lower the heat, cover the pan and let it cook.  You will need to stir it from time to time.  The idea here is to cook it without adding any additional water.  If you have a good, non-stick pan and a tight lid this is possible.</p>
								<p>When the vegetables are tender add the garam masala, lemon juice to taste, and adjust the salt.</p>
								<p>Sprinkle the chopped cilantro over the top.</p>
								<p>HAPPY EATING!!</p>
