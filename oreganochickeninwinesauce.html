						<h1>OREGANO CHICKEN IN WINE SAUCE</h1>
						<div class="article">
						<p><a class="boldlink" href="index.html">back to recipe list</a></p>	
						<p>This is one of my own recipes.  I've been making it for years.  It's very simple...but very delicious!</p>
						<p>Boneless, skinless thighs work best for this recipe. I've tried it with boneless, skinless breasts and found it too dry for my taste.  It works pretty well with pork chops though.</p>
						<p>All amounts are approximate. Don't worry about it.  Be free!  You can't really go wrong with this one.</p>

						<h2>ingredients</h2>
						<p>5-6 boneless, skinless chicken thighs</p>
						<p></p>
						<p>Approximately 0.75 cup white wine (Something cheap with work)</p>

						<p>Olive oil</p>
						<p>Freshly grated parmesan cheese</p>
						 

						<h2>instructions</h2>
						<p>Saute the thighs in olive oil until golden brown on both sides.</p>
						<p>Add wine, lemon juice, oregano, salt and pepper. If necessary add a little water to half-way cover the chicken. (You don't want to compeltely cover the chicken!)</p>

						<p>Serve over rice.(I use basmati)</p>
						<p>Sprinkle with parmesan cheese.</p>
