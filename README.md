# Responsive-Recipes

As I was reading Ethan Marcotte's book "Reponsive Web Design" I started following along by copying his code and creating a simple website out of it.  Eventually, after some playing around, it turned into a site for my favorite recipes.

The choice of background color, fonts, and the very simple utensil illustration is my attempt to to mimic (somewhat) the style of natural foods cookbooks from the 1970s (Moosewood, The Vegetarian Epicure etc.)
