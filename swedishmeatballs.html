						<h1>SWEDISH MEATBALLS</h1>

						<p><a class="boldlink" href="index.html">back to recipe list</a></p>	
						<p>Hmm....from where exactly did I get this recipe? At the top, just underneath the name, it says that it "makes the best gravy I have ever tasted." So, I Googled that and found the recipe <a href="http://community.tasteofhome.com/community_forums/f/30/t/32947.aspx">here</a>. It was posted by "Angelpam" in 2004.  I have to agree with "Angelpam" about this one.  It really is good. It's surprisingly tasty despite the fact that it doesn't call for onions.</p>
						<p>Hint: Half pork, half beef is even more delicious. You can even use ground turkey for a lighter flavor.  It works very well.</p>

						<h2>ingredients for meatballs</h2>
						<p>1 pound (.5 kilo) ground beef</p>

						<p>Shape the meat mixture into small balls and brown in 1/4 cup hot fat. Remove and set aside.</p>
						<p>Mix the flour, salt, paprika, and pepper in a small saucepan. Slowly add the milk and the boiling water. You should use a whisk to keep lumps from forming. Pour it into the pan in which you browned the meatballs and cook it until it starts to thicken a bit.  Return the cooked meatballs to the gravy and simmer 15-20 minutes.</p>
