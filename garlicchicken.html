						<h1>GARLIC CHICKEN</h1>
							<div class="article">
							<p><a class="boldlink" href="index.html">back to recipe list</a></p>	
							<p>I found the original recipe on allrecipes.com. However, it seems to have disappeared now. It's either that or their search feature is crap.  My printout says that it was submitted by "Carol". So..hats off to her because it's delicious.</p>
							<p>Works well with boneless, skinless thighs as well.  I usually serve it with rice or mashed potatoes.</p>
