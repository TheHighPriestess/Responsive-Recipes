						<h1>ELIZABETH'S RESPONSIVE RECIPES</h1>
						<div class="article">	
						<p>A personal collection of recipes (gathered from books & websites) put into a very simple responsive website. If the viewport falls below 768px both the introductory text that you're reading now and the recipes will stack.  Cool!</p>
						<p>This website started as a way to learn the basics of responsive web design.  I was reading <a href="http://abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design">Responsive Web Design by Ethan Marcotte</a> (recommended) and decided to actively follow along by creating a site for my favorite recipes.  I hope to eventually get them all up.</p>
						<p>I first started cooking when I was around 12 years old. I must have been rather ambitious because one of my first culinary creations was an exotic chicken dish involving cherries.  By the time I was 15 I was doing most of the cooking at home. My mother loved my hobby.</p>  
						<p>It's crazy that so many people today, especially women, don't know how to cook.  I can't imagine not knowing how to cook. Everyone should know how to cook. It's a necessary skill.</p>
