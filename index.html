						<h1>ELIZABETH'S RESPONSIVE RECIPES</h1>
						<div class="article">	
						<p>A personal collection of recipes (gathered from books & websites) put into a very simple responsive website. If the viewport falls below 768px both the introductory text that you're reading now and the recipes will stack.</p>
						<p>This website started as a way to learn the basics of responsive web design.  I was reading <a href="http://abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design">Responsive Web Design by Ethan Marcotte</a> (Recommended) and decided to actively follow along by creating a site for my favorite recipes.</p>
						<p>I first started cooking when I was around 12 years old. On the way home from school I used to stop off at the main branch of the <a href="https://multcolib.org/"> Multnomah County Library</a> in order to browse through the cookbooks. I must have been rather ambitious because one of my first culinary creations was an exotic chicken dish involving cherries.  By the time I was 15 I was doing most of the cooking at home.</p>  
						<p>I find it shocking that many people today, especially women, don't know how to cook.  I can't imagine not knowing how to cook. Everyone should know how to cook. It really is a necessary skill.</p>
