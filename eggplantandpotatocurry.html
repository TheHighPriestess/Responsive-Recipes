						<h1>Eggplant and Potato Dry Curry</h1>
						<div class="article">	
						<p>I found this recipe on a terrific site for Indian recipes: mamtaskitchen.com. You can find the original recipe here. These are my very slight adjustments...how I make it.</p>
						<p>I use a non-stick, wok-style pan from IKEA with a heavy glass lid for these dry curry recipes. However, the bottom of it is rather thin and I have to be careful not to burn the vegetables.  A pan with a heavy bottom and a heavy, tight fitting lid, would be ideal for these dry curry recipes.</p>

						<h2 class="indian">ingredients</h2>
						<p>250 grams eggplant, cut into small pieces 1-3 inches</p>
						<p>250 grams potatoes, chopped into 1-2 inch pieces</p>
						<p>2 tablespoons or so of oil (I use olive oil)</p>
						<p>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</p>
						<p>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</p>
						<p>1.5 teaspoons coriander powder</p>
						<p>0.5 teaspoon turmeric</p>
						<p>0.25 teaspoon cayenne powder</p>
						<p>salt to taste</p>
						<p>0.5 teaspoon garam masala powder</p>
						<p>0.5 tablespoon lemon juice</p>
						<p>1 tablespoon chopped cilantro</p>

						<h2 class="greek">instructions</h2>
						<p>Heat the oil and when hot add cumin seeds. When they start to sizzle and darken a bit add the ginger and the chopped green chili.  Fry for 30 seconds or so.</p>
						<p>Add the chopped vegetables, the spices (except for the garam masala), salt and saute for a minute or so until the vegetables are coated with the spices.</p>
						<p>Lower the heat, cover the pan and let it cook.  You will need to stir it from time to time.  The idea here is to cook it without adding any additional water.  If you have a good, non-stick pan and a tight lid this is possible.</p>
						<p>When the vegetables are tender add the garam masala and adjust the salt.</p>
						<p>Sprinkle the chopped cilantro over the top.</p>
						<p>HAPPY EATING!!</p>
